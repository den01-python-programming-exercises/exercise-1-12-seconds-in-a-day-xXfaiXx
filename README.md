# Exercise 1.12 - Seconds in a day

In the exercise template, implement a program that asks the user for the number of days. After that, the program prints the number of seconds in the given number of days.

In the course material, we learned to read an input in the following manner:

```python
number = int(input('Give a number:'))
```

Examples of expected output:
